This is the prototype of a game engine I created back in 2013 for a simple platformer.

The graphics are from OpenGameArt.org, and specificaly the possum character is a creation by Redshrike (Stephen Challener), commissioned by OpenGameArt.org. Link: https://opengameart.org/content/the-awesome-possum-ultimate-smash-friends
